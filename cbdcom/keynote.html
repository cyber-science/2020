                <b>Abstract</b>: For several years cloud computing has been a very popular computing paradigm for the deployment and execution of time-sensitive applications. It provides infrastructure from its virtually infinite pool of resources billed in a pay-as-you-go basis that enables the cloud users to run their applications in a cost-effective way.
</p><p>For efficient cloud performance and quality of service, issues related to resource allocation, application scheduling, timeliness, cost and energy conservation need to be addressed. A particularly challenging issue is to run complex real-time applications in the cloud. Effective scheduling policies should be used ensuring that real-time applications will meet their deadlines as well as the overall quality of service will be improved.
</p><p>Due to the explosive growth of Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, fog computing has appeared recently as a novel computing model beyond cloud computing to face problems related to large network traffic and communication delay. The majority of the IoT applications are real-time as decisions must be made in a short time. Therefore, new resource allocation techniques and scheduling policies are required for efficient utilization of the resources and for timeliness. Delay-sensitive applications should be assigned to appropriate resources at the fog and cloud layers, based on their communication and computational characteristics. 
</p><p>	In this talk we will focus on techniques and solutions to address the challenges faced in resource allocation and scheduling of real-time applications in the cloud and in the fog and we will provide future trends in the cloud and fog computing area.
