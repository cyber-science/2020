                <b>Abstract</b>: The growing presence of high-performance cameras and microphones throughout the everyday environment has enabled the remote acquisition of biometric identity information such as the face, voice, and gait and even fingerprints, veins, and iris that can be easily shared in cyberspace. This capability poses a threat in that it provides other means of “spoofing” biometric authentication systems in order to commit fraud. Measures must thus be taken to protect such systems against the misuse of biometric information. On the other hand, since biometric authentication has become widely used as a means of personal authentication, the provision of such biometric information at the time of authentication must be made as convenient as possible. This talk introduces the challenges faced regarding security and privacy against the acquisition of a person’s biometric identity information and the distribution of that information in cyberspace on the basis of that person’s wishes while maintaining the practical convenience of biometric authentication. It also describes fruitful demonstration testing using a prototype aimed at meeting these challenges.<br/><br/>

                <b>Abstract</b>: Service-oriented computing has profoundly affected the personal computing experience. Users no longer run every application and store their data on a single computer. Instead they own and operate a complex multi-device ensemble made of desktop computers, laptops, tablets, phones, watches, glasses, cars, or any sort of internet-connected thing to manage their personal information and accomplish their tasks by accessing software delivered as a service. Many approaches to achieve a liquid user experience whereby data and software can seamlessly flow and adapt across smart devices are starting to appear within proprietary platforms relying on centralized solutions, where data is conveniently stored in the Cloud, outside the control of the users producing and consuming it. In this talk we discuss how the open Web currently undergoing a re-decentralization might still play an important role within a programmable smart world.<br/><br/>

                <b>Abstract</b>: We are living in an increasingly smarter world where we do business, communicate and recreate among and across physical, cyber, social and mental spaces. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) offers mechanisms, technologies and tools which integrate and interweave physical entities, e.g. the internet of things, smart objects and devices and embedded systems, cyber entities, e.g. apps, social software and algorithms, and mental machinery, to support and facilitate cross-space multi-modal interactions and functionalities. The challenge is how smart CPSs should or can be in order to meet varying needs of different cohorts of users, and one of the core enabling technologies is computational behaviour analysis which can discover individual users’ ways of performing tasks, thus supporting advanced features, such as adaptation, personalisation and decision-making recommendation. In this talk the speaker will characterise the smart world concepts, and examine closely the research issues, methodologies and approaches to computational behaviour analysis which underpin the new wave smart cyber-physical systems. After this he will present his recent research and initial results in e-learning, healthcare and social network analysis describing the latest behaviour modelling and analysis technologies. He will then discuss research challenges and future directions which are aimed at stimulating and enlightening new ideas and approaches in this emerging research area.<br/><br/>

                <b>Abstract</b>: In Large Scale Computing System (LSCS), there is a critical and challenging issue: it is almost impossible for humans to manually diagnose/recover/defend numerous faults/failures/threatens/attacks of a great number of distributed components in a timely manner due to the large scale. The work presneted integration of Artificial Intelligence into dependability issues of LSNS. It proposed a prototype technology to self-improve the reliability for LSNS to enable a LSCS self-learning capability. The model systematically built the architecture of BANS (Bionic Autonomic Nervous System) that is a kind of nature-inspired technology. The BANS architecture implemented cyber-neurons/axons/peripheral nerves/central nerves, and the AI algorithms embedded in the BANS combined Neural Network, Fuzzy Logic,and Multi-value Diagrams for supervised machine-learning and reinforcement self-learning. This innovative technology enabled LSCS the capability of self-diagnosis and self-healing functions.<br/><br/>

                <b>Abstract</b>: In the Cyber-Physical-Natural (CPN) ecosystem, everyone is an information user and an information provider. This level of complexity has produced ample opportunity but created many challenges for data analytics and model fusion. The situation in the big data era requires intricate experiments with more variables (cues, criteria, features, attributes, or indicators) and larger number of hypotheses. In a new data analytic paradigm, various ensemble methods combining multiple models or multiple machine learning algorithms are now frequently used to improve forecasting, prediction, and decision making. However, it remains to be a challenging problem as to when and how to combine these models or systems.
                This keynote presentation will cover the design of intelligent scoring systems and discuss when and how multiple scoring systems (MSS’s) should be combined using rank-score characteristic (RSC) function and cognitive diversity (CD). We illustrate methods and practices of this new paradigm in cyber science and technology with diverse examples ranging from figure skating judgement to drug discovery virtual screening (VS), from evidence review in e-discovery to intrusion detection in cybersecurity, and from network selection in wireless communication to multi-layer combinational fusion in deep learning.
