                To help assist our authors and participants applying for invitation letter and Japanese VISA, this page will give explanations about the following key points.
            <br/><br/>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>If you only need an English invitation letter, please download and fill in Part A of the invitation letter request form. Then, please email your request to cyberscitechcongress@gmail.com with the subject “Invitation letter request” and attached the filled request form in MS Word format, together with your registration payment confirmation from Nishitetsu Travel. An electronic invitation letter will be emailed to you.</li>
                <br/>
            <li>Please note, before requesting for an invitation letter, please complete your registration first. If multiple authors of one paper all plan to attend the conference and need invitation letters, all have to register accordingly (please refer to the registration instruction page: http://cyber-science.org/2019/picom/ -> Attend -> Participant Registration), and then make separate requests by providing their request forms.</li>
                <br/>
            <li>If you also need to apply for a Japanese VISA, please fill in Parts B, C & D of the information collection form. Two sample forms are provided below as examples to assist in filling the form.</li>
                <br/>
            <li>The required additional VISA application documents (Invitation Reason Statement/招へい理由書, Schedule of Stay/滞在予定表, Certificate of Employment/在職証明書) will be made and mailed to you. An additional charge of 4000 JPY will be charged and added to your total registration fee when selecting the item [Visa Application Document and Postal Fee] in online registration.</li>
