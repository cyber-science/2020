        <h3>Call for Tutorials</h3>
        <p>

The 2020 IEEE Cyber Science and Technology Congress (CyberSciTech 2020) provides a common platform for scientists, researchers and engineers to exchange their latest ideas and outcomes in research, technology and science. It is also the venue to exchange the latest advances in cyberspace studies with its broad scope of cyber-related sciences, technologies, and applications topics. It will be held jointly with 18th IEEE International Conf. on Pervasive Intelligence & Computing (PICom 2020); the 18th IEEE International Conf. on Dependable, Autonomic & Secure Comp (DASC 2020); and the 6th IEEE Int'l Conf. on Cloud and Big Data Computing (CBDCom 2020). In addition to the technical program, the congress will also feature tutorials and panels.
 </p><p>CyberSciTech 2020 welcomes proposals for short and long tutorials from active researchers and experienced tutors. Higher preference will be given for tutorials on interdisciplinary directions, novel and emerging new cyber-enabled sciences, technologies, and applications for a better society.
 </p><p>A proposal should cover the following items:

        </p>

<ul><li> Tutorial title
</li><li>Names and affiliations of presenters
</li><li>Tutorial abstract (200 words maximum)
</li><li>	Tutorial description, including the objectives of the tutorial, its relevance to CyberSciTech, description of the intended audience and background assumed of the audience.
</li><li>	Expected audience size
</li><li>	Length of the tutorial: short (1.5-2 hours) or long (3-4 hours)
</li><li>	A list of forums with their time, locations and estimate of the number of attendees if the tutorial or a similar/highly related tutorial has been presented by the same authors before, and highlight the similarity/difference between those and the one proposed for CyberSciTech 2020 (up to 150 words for each entry)
</li><li>	A list of tutorials on the same/similar/highly related topics given by other people, and highlight the difference between yours and theirs (up to 150 words for each entry)
</li><li>	A list of other tutorials given by the authors; please list the titles, the presenters, the forums, locations and estimate of the number of attendees only
</li><li>	Authorsâ€™ short bio and their expertise related to the tutorial (up to 150 words per tutor)
</li><li>	An outline of the tutorial in the form of a bullet list (up to one page)
</li><li>	A list of up to 25 most important references that will be covered in the tutorial
</li><li>	Any specific audio/video/computer requirements for the tutorial
</li><li>	URLs of the slides/notes of the previous tutorials given by the authors
</li></ul>
<p>
Please kindly send your proposals to the Tutorial Chair of IEEE CyberSci&Tech Congress,  Dr. Hao Zhu at  <a href="mailto:Pzhuhao@cqupt.edu.cn">zhuhao@cqupt.edu.cn</a>.
