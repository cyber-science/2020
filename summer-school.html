<h3>Summer School on Trusted AI for Autonomous Systems - TAS</h3>

 

<h4>Scope and Objectives </h4>

 

<p>This <b>Summer School</b> is organized by the participants of the <b>Canadian IDEaS micro-net “AutoDefence: Trustworthy Technologies for Autonomous Human-Machine Systems“</b> that involves academic researchers and the Department of National Defence (DND) Canada. This Summer School aims to disseminate the developed knowledge and expertise, especially among young researchers entering the field, and enable exchange of ideas within the international research community.
</p><p>
This event will include the Keynote speaker from the DND, as well as Tutorials (Lectures) by the participants of the IDEaS micro-net "Autodefence". The graduate students/ participants of the Summer Schools will be able to submit their research paper (workshop format, up to 6 pages) and present them at the Poster session.
</p><p>
 The research papers shall address the following aspects of trusted AI and autonomous systems: 
</p><p>
<ul><li>    Trustworthy decision-support system
 </li><li>   Cognitive load analyses for autonomous systems in contested environments
</li><li>    Autonomous neural networks and learning systems for defence robots
</li><li>    Cognitive and affective computing for trustable human-machine interactions
</li><li>    Trustworthy data analytics for adversarial decision-making
</li><li>    Distributed autonomous agent-systems
</li><li>    Adaptable and adversarial system configurations
 </li><li>   Trust and reliability in networked human-robot task-forces.

<b>Dr. Henry Leung</b>
</p><p>
Before joining the University of Calgary, Dr. Henry Leung was with the Department of National Defence (DND) of Canada as a defence scientist to conduct research and development of decision support systems, radar signal processing and data fusion. He was appointed as the national leader to represent Canada for the TTCP cooperative program on radar data processing and sensor fusion. His current research includes data mining, information fusion, machine learning, nonlinear dynamics, decision support, robotics, sensor networks and intern of things. He has published extensively in the open literature on these topics. He has over 240 journal papers and over 200 refereed conference papers. He also holds more than 15 patents. He is also a visiting professor of the Shanghau JiaoTong University, PR China (2017-2020) and a HaiTien academic visiting professor of the Dalian University of Technology, PR China (20180-2020). Dr. Leung is the Topical Editor of the International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems on Robotic Sensors. He is the editor of the Springer book series on “Information Fusion and Data Science”. He is currently the associate editor of various journals such as IEEE Trans. Aerospace and Electronic Systems, IEEE Circuits and System Magazine, IEICE Trans. on Nonlinear Theory and Applications. He was the chair of the Nonlinear Circuits and Systems of the IEEE Circuit and System Society and has served on the program committee, organizing committee, track chairs for various conferences. He has also served as guest editors for various journals such as “Intelligent Transportation Systems” for the International Journal on Information Fusion, “Cognitive Sensor Networks” and “Deep Learning for Multi-sensor Multi-source Information Fusion” for the IEEE Sensor Journal. He is a Fellow of IEEE and SPIE.

<b>Dr. Svetlana Yanushkevich</b>
</p><p>
Dr. Svetlana Yanushkevich directs the Biometric Technologies Laboratory at the University of Calgary, the only research facility dedicated to the biometric systems design in Canada. She received her Dr. Sci (Dr. Habilitated) degree from Technical University of Warsaw in 1999. She was with West-Pomeranian University of Technology, Szczecin, Poland, prior to joining the ECE Department at the University of Calgary in 2001. She is now a Full professor in the ECE Department. She conducted two Canada Safety and Security Program Projects for Canadian Government: one with the Canadian Border Service Agency (CBSA) and another one with RCMP, on border security and counteracting the threats to public safety in 2013-2016. She led two NATO Collaborative Linkage Grants in 2004 and 2013. Currently, she leads the Canadian Micro-net “AutoDefense:” composed the research teams from U of Calgary, U of Toronto, U of Waterloo, McGill and Concordia University. Dr. Yanushkevich contributed to the area of AI for digital design and biometrics since 1996. Most recently, she and her team has developed novel risk assessment strategies based on machine reasoning, with applications to biometric-enabled border control, forensics and healthcare.

<h4>Plans for Dissemination</h4> 

<p>

The information about the <b>Summer School</b> will be distributed among the Micro-net (teams of 9 researchers from 5 Canadian universities) and their vast network of collaborators. The graduate students from these collaborating teams will be able to submit their research paper (workshop format, up to 6 pages) and present them at the Poster session. Best paper and poster will be selected for an award.
