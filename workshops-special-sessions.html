        <h3>Call for Workshops and Special Sessions</h3>
        <p>
IEEE CyberSciTech 2020 invites Workshops and Special Sessions (SS) to enrich and broaden the research focus of the main conference. The purpose is to provide a comprehensive forum on topics that will not be fully explored during the main event, as well as to encourage in-depth discussion of technical and application issues related to Cyber Science and Technology. This is a unique opportunity for researchers and industry practitioners to shape the future research directions as well as share their original research results and practical development experiences on specific topics related to cyber science and technology. 
        </p><p>
The proposals should contain the following information: 
<ul><li> The title of the Workshop/SS, including both full name and abbreviation
    </li><li> The scope and objectives (up to 1 page)
</li><li>	Short bios of the key organizers
</li><li>	Brief plans for dissemination (e.g., how to advertise the Workshop/SS or possible submissions to special issues of journals), procedures for selecting papers (including the expected number of accepted papers), and the expected number of participants
</li><li>	A tentative website/URL of the proposed Workshop/SS (optional)
</li><li> If the proposed Workshop/SS has been previously organized, please also briefly describe its history (e.g., number of submissions and accepted papers, attendance, etc.)
</li></ul>
        </p><p>
    Please email your proposals in PDF format as early as possible, and not later than Nov. 30, 2019 to 
    Workshop Chair Dr Ali Dewan at <a href="mailto:"adewan@athabascau.ca">adewan@athabascau.ca</a> and CC to Program Chair Dr Xiaokang Zhou at <a href="mailto:"zhou@biwako.shiga-u.ac.jp">zhou@biwako.shiga-u.ac.jp</a>. Please use “IEEE CyberSciTech 2020 Workshop/SS Proposal” as the email subject. Once we receive a proposal, a decision will be made in a week. Accepted proposals should follow strictly the important dates, particularly paper notification and camera-ready dates listed below. 
    </p><hr/><h3>
Important Dates for CyberSciTech 2020 Workshops/SS
    </h3>
<ul><li>  Workshop/SS Paper Due: March 10, 2020
</li><li>	Authors Notification: March 31, 2020
</li><li>	Camera-ready Submission: May 10, 2020
</li></ul>
<p>
    
    For accepted proposals, organizers are responsible for composing the corresponding Workshop/SS program committees, advertising call for papers, reviewing submissions, and planning the final program. IEEE CyberSciTech 2020 Workshop/SS Chairs will assist the organization and ensure their quality and success. The IEEE CyberSciTech Congress organizer will provide facilities including the paper submission systems, working notes printing, meeting rooms, coffee breaks, lunches, proceedings preparation, etc. 
  </p><p>
A Workshop/SS paper should be 4-6 pages, following the same Paper Submission Guidelines as the main Congress papers. Each paper should be reviewed at least by two reviewers in the corresponding areas. All accepted Workshop/SS papers will be included in the proceedings published by IEEE-CS Conference Publishing Services in IEEE-DL and EI index. 
  </p><p>
The accepted papers in a cancelled Workshop/SS may be moved to another Workshop/SS, or to a main Congress track if they fit the quality requirement. The registration requirement and procedure for Workshop/SS papers will be determined by IEEE CyberSciTech 2020 Organizing Committee, and the registration fee will be paid directly to IEEE CyberSciTech 2020. The registration fee can be waived for a Workshop/SS’s main organizer if there are more than 10 accepted papers. 
</p><p>
We are looking forward to your exciting proposals.
