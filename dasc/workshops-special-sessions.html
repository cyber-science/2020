<h3>Call for Workshops and Special Sessions (DASC 2020)</h3>
<p>
IEEE DASC 2020 invites Workshops and Special Sessions (SS) to enrich and broaden the research focus of the main conference. The purpose is to provide a comprehensive forum on topics that will not be fully explored during the main event, as well as to encourage in-depth discussion of technical and application issues related to dependability, security, and automaticity. This is a unique opportunity for researchers and industry practitioners to shape the future research directions as well as share their original research results and practical development experiences on specific topics related to dependability, security, and automaticity.

</p><ul><li>
 Title of the Workshop/SS, including both full name and abbreviation;

</li><li> Brief technical description of the Workshop/SS, scope and objectives, identification of specific technical issues, focus (up to 1 page);
